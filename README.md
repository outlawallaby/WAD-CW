# This repository is created as a Part of Web Application Development Module Assignment by Westminster University Student with ID 00008487.

The project was based on an existing INSTAGRAM managed by me and my friends, channel for the sale of goods from the United States, in particular cosmetics for skin care.

In order to make it easier for customers to purchase and place orders, it was decided to create an online store based on a .Net Core 3.1 framework with a client and administrator 
UI.
